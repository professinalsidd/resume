            I am a dedicated and innovative Frontend Developer with nearly three
            years of hands-on experience in crafting intuitive and responsive
            web and mobile applications. With a strong foundation in React.js
            and React Native, I specialize in creating seamless user experiences
            and dynamic interfaces. My expertise extends to state management
            with Redux Toolkit, robust code development using TypeScript, and
            designing visually appealing UIs with tools like Material UI and
            Figma.
